# 🎯 SureScore – Confidence-Based Quiz Platform

SureScore is not your typical quiz app.  
It’s an **evolved online quiz platform** that doesn’t just check if you *know the answer* — it also checks how **confident** you are about it.  

In real life, knowledge isn’t just about being right or wrong. Sometimes you’re **sure**, sometimes you’re **unsure**, and sometimes you just **guess**.  
SureScore rewards honesty and self-awareness, making assessments more **fair, rigorous, and insightful**.

## 🌟 Why SureScore?
Traditional quiz systems have a big shortcoming:  
They only measure whether an answer is **correct** or **wrong**.  

SureScore introduces **confidence-based assessment**:
- ✅ **High Confidence**
- ⚖️ **Medium Confidence**
- ❓ **Low Confidence**

### 🔢 How scoring works
- If you answer **correctly with high confidence** → 🎉 you’re rewarded generously.
- If you answer **wrong with high confidence** → 🚨 you’re penalized heavily (because you were overconfident).
- If you answer **correctly but with low confidence** → 👍 you still get rewarded, just less.
- If you’re **guessing** → you can’t “cheat” your way to a high score.

This way, **students who truly know themselves** score better than those who just guess.
